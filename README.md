## 📜 **How to Run Locally**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/solar-system-planet-facts.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-system-planet-facts
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. **Solar System Animation**: 
   - A `div` for each orbit and planet with `@keyframes` handles rotation and animation.
   - Orbits and planets are styled and animated independently.
2. **Planet Facts**:
   - A JavaScript object stores facts for each planet.
   - Clicking a button triggers the `showFacts()` function, displaying facts and auto-switching them every 2 seconds.
